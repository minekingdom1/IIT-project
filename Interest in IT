		<h3> What is/was my interest in IT? When did my interest in IT begin? </h3>
		<h2> When I was younger, I watched anime and decided I wanted to either build a robot or mecha, which is a large armoured robot, typically controlled by a person riding inside the robot itself or a full dive system from sword art online. As a result, programming became my focus. It turned into me liking programming and the euphoria that comes with finding a way to solve something.</h2>
		<h3> Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest? Outline my IT experience (if any). </h3>
		<h2> </h2>
		<h3> Why did my choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
		<h2> The name RMIT is an abbreviation of Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. In terms of IT, RMIT just came to mind first. </h2>
		<h3> What do my expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
		<h2> Programming languages, What user-centred design is and how useful it is, how to utilize a database and much more. </h2>
